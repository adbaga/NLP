During the Iron Age, what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by the 
Gauls, a Celtic people. Rome annexed the area in 51 BC, holding it until the 
arrival of Germanic Franks in 476, who formed the Kingdom of Francia. The 
Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned Francia into East Francia, Middle Francia 
and West Francia. West Francia, which became the Kingdom of France in 987, 
emerged as a major European power in the Late Middle Ages, following its 
victory in the Hundred Year's War (1337 - 1453). During the Renaissance, 
French culture flourished and a global colonial empire was established, which by the 
20th century would become the second largest in the world. The 16th century 
was dominated by religious civil wars between Catholics and Protestants 
(Huguenots). France became Europe's dominant cultural, political, and 
military power in the 17th century under Louis XIV. In the late 18th century, 
French Revolution overthrew the absolute monarchy, establishing one of modern 
the history's earliest republics and drafting the Declaration of the Rights 
of Man and of the Citizen, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day.
